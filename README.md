## Setup Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omaymaprojects/energy-mlops.git
    cd energy-mlops
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

## Deployment

### Heroku

To deploy the application on Heroku, ensure you have the Heroku CLI installed and then follow these steps:

1. **Login to Heroku**:
    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

2. **Create a new Heroku app**:
    ```bash
    heroku create
    ```

3. **Deploy the application**:
    ```bash
    git push heroku master
    ```

### Render
